# Evaluation Protocol Audit

## Current training-time evaluation

`third_party/street_gaussian/train.py` contains two different diagnostic
paths:

1. `training_report()` writes `metrics/eval_iter_XXXXXX_per_view.csv` and
   appends `metrics/eval_summary.csv`.
2. `_write_periodic_eval()` writes fixed-view visual panels under
   `periodic_eval/iter_XXXXXX/`.

`training_report()` now has two training-time protocols:

- `sampled_diagnostic_eval`: every 1000 iterations, up to 15 train views and
  up to 15 test views.
- `full_split_training_eval`: every 5000 iterations, full train and full test
  splits when enabled.

Both protocols report `test/test_view` from `scene.getTestCameras()` and
`test/train_view` from `scene.getTrainCameras()`, with the sampled protocol
using a deterministic subsample. CSV rows include `eval_protocol`, so sampled
and full-split curves cannot be mixed silently.

`_write_periodic_eval()` is a visual diagnostic. It now defaults to 15 fixed
views, 5 cameras x 3 frames, and saves comparison panels every 1000 iterations.
It is not a full split metric.

## Why current PSNR curves can shake

Older `paper_results` PSNR/L1 curves were built from
`metrics/eval_summary.csv` when `test/train_view` contained only five sampled
training views. Those older curves can shake because:

- `test/train_view` contains only five training views;
- `test/test_view` may be empty or much smaller depending on `data.split_test`;
- per-view difficulty and opacity/densification state can dominate a small
  sample;
- train-time eval is interleaved with checkpoint/save/densification events.

After the sampled/full split update, sampled curves should be used only for
low-cost training diagnostics; full-split curves can support training-dynamics
figures at 5000-iteration cadence. The main quantitative paper table should
still use final full evaluation at the chosen checkpoint.

## Original Street Gaussians reference

The Street Gaussians paper evaluates rendering quality with PSNR, SSIM, and
LPIPS, and reports a moving-object-region PSNR variant in the Waymo table.
For Waymo, the paper states that every fourth image is selected as test and
the remaining images are used for training. The released `metrics.py` computes
PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS from rendered image folders for train/test splits.

Local code references:

- `third_party/street_gaussian/metrics.py`: full-image PSNR/SSIM/LPIPS over
  rendered train/test folders.
- `third_party/street_gaussian/render.py`: renders `scene.getTrainCameras()`
  and `scene.getTestCameras()` in evaluate mode.
- `third_party/street_gaussian/lib/datasets/waymo_full_readers.py`: builds
  train/test cameras using `split_train` / `split_test`; object masks are
  stored as `guidance["obj_bound"]`.

## GeoFeedback-GS formal evaluation plan

Training-time `periodic_eval` and `eval_summary.csv` remain diagnostics.
Main paper results must use final held-out test evaluation by default:

```bash
python scripts/final_evaluate_experiments.py \
  --configs \
    configs/experiments/a100_baseline_streetgs.yaml \
    configs/experiments/a100_da3_only.yaml \
    configs/experiments/a100_da3_periodic_group_softpatch.yaml \
    configs/experiments/a100_pv_da3_feedback_obj.yaml \
  --output-root outputs/final_evaluation_test_only_v2 \
  --loaded-iter 30000 \
  --splits test
```

The script appends per-view CSV rows during evaluation and resumes by default.
Use `--overwrite` for a clean rerun. Full train+test evaluation remains
available with `--splits test train`, but is not the default because it is much
more expensive than the held-out test split.

Outputs:

```text
outputs/final_evaluation_test_only_v2/
  <experiment>/
    metrics_full_image.csv
    metrics_object_region.csv
    metrics_background_region.csv
    summary_by_scope.csv
    figures/final_comparison_panels/
  summary_main.csv
  summary_by_scope.csv
```

Required scopes:

- `full_image`: all valid pixels.
- `object_region`: pixels from `obj_bound`; if object branch is disabled or no
  object pixels are present, rows are marked `not_applicable`.
- `background_region`: valid pixels outside object masks.

Paper evidence scripts now prefer `final_full_evaluation_summary.csv` for main
tables. By default they read `outputs/final_evaluation_test_only_v2`; use
`--final-eval-root` to collect another final evaluation directory.
